Mute Conversation (2015)
<br><span class="subtitle">Yuri Pattison</span>
</p>

<main>
<p>
Pattison's online work, commissioned by the ICA, features two chatbots in conversation with each other. 
</p>
<p>
One bot is programmed by the artist, using fragments of critical texts that address the issues that the digital world has seen develop since the 1980s including <i>The California Ideology, A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace, The Hacker Manifesto</i> and <i>the Crypto Anarchist Manifesto.</i>
</p>
<p>
The other bot exists as a more sophisticated and independent online service programmed by its ongoing interactions with human users. Since both agents evolve from their interactions, Pattisonâ€™s work is therefore changed with each visit. The artist's programming is gradually eroded or augmented with new information, entering into a continual recycling of data and information online.
