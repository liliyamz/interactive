Created at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, ELIZA is a natural language conversation program simulating a Rogerian psychotherapist using a set of scripted rules to respond to user inputs. Considered the first chatbot, ELIZA was also one of the first programs capable of passing the Turing Test.

Weizenbaum meant for ELIZA to demonstrate the superficiality of communication between man and machine. However, despite his insistence to the contrary, many users attributed human-like emotions to the program. In an article, Weizenbaum discusses the thinking behind ELIZA:
</p>
<div class="indent"><p>
"At this writing, the only serious ELIZA scripts which exist are some which cause ELIZA to respond roughly as would certain psychotherapists (Rogerians). ELIZA performs best when its human correspondent is initially instructed to "talk" to it, via the typewriter of course, just as one would to a psychiatrist. This mode of conversation was chosen because the psychiatric interview is one of the few examples of categorized dyadic natural language communication in which one of the participating pair is free to assume the pose of knowing almost nothing of the real world. If, for example, one were to tell a psychiatrist "I went for a long boat ride" and he responded "Tell me about boats", one would not assume that he knew nothing about boats, but that he had some purpose in so directing the subsequent conversation. It is important to note that this assumption is one made by the speaker. Whether it is realistic or not is an altogether separate question. In any case, it has a crucial psychological utility in that it serves the speaker to maintain his sense of being heard and understood. The speaker further defends his impression (which even in real life may be illusory) by attributing to his conversational partner all sorts of background knowledge, insights and reasoning ability. But again, these are the speaker's contribution to the conversation."
