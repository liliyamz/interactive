<p>
Bina48, short for Breakthrough Intelligence via Neural Architecture 48, is a humanoid robot consisting of a head and shoulders mounted on a frame. Owned by Rothblatt's Terasem Movement, Incorporated, Bina48 was modeled after Rothblatt's wife through more than one hundred hours compiling her memories, feelings, and beliefs.

Bruce Duncan, Terasem Movement Foundation's executive director, described in an interview:
</p>
<div class="indent"><p>
"[BINA48 was commissioned to] test the feasibility of transferring consciousness from a human to a biological or technological body.

<ol>
<li>An imprint of a person's consciousness can be created in a digital form, called a 'mindfile', by collecting detailed information about that person. That information can then be expressed in a future, not-yet-created type of software, called 'mindware'. </li>
<li>That same imprint of a person's consciousness can be placed in a biological or technological body to provide life experiences comparable to those of a typically birthed human." BINA48 is an early test of these two hypotheses. </li>
</ol>
BINA48 was createdâ€¦[as] an early demonstration of the transfer of information from a human being to a computer."
