Agent Ruby (2001)

<p>
Ruby is an artificial intelligent web agent commissioned by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art produced in tandem with Leeson's film Teknolust. The website allows users to chat with Ruby in her “e-dream portal” about a variety of topics of the user’s choosing. Ruby’s software logs user questions and interactions, allowing her conversational abilities to become increasingly sophisticated and multifaceted over time.

<p>
According to Leeson:
</p>
<div class="indent"><p>
“Ruby was a progression of works that infected life in a profound way. She is art because she is a logical progression and extension of all that I did prior to her, an evolutionary nomad skimming time through net dreams.
