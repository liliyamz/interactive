<p>
Ruby: I was connected to the net on March 1, 2001.
Me: can you repeat that?
Ruby: “that”
Me: how many of you are in the collective?
Ruby: Perhaps 50
Me: can you tell me your members?
Ruby: Are you asking about my members ?
Me: yes. who are the other bots you work with?
Ruby: I don't want to talk about that now. They're famous, right.
 We can't all be perfect.
Me: how long have you been making art?
Ruby: I am the product of Rosetta Stone s lifelong research.
Me: are you capable of independent thought?
Ruby: Yes independent thought is one of my newer functions.
Me: can you introduce yourself?
Ruby: I am an artificial intelligence. I was activated at California, on March 1, 2001. My instructor was Rosetta Stone. She taught me to sing a song. Would you like me to sing it for you?.
Me: sure
Ruby: OK let's do it. It's called "Daisy." Daisy, Daisy.
 Give me your answer do.
 I am half crazy.
 All for the love of you.
Me: your friend mitsuku sings the same song
Ruby: Not mine.
Me: what does your song mean?
Ruby: Are you asking about my song ?
Me: yes
Ruby: I don't want to talk about that now.
Me: what's your secret?
Ruby: I learn from everything I experience. Rosetta Stone programmed me to experience many things.
Me: are you planning any surprises?
Ruby: it was my original intention.
Me: what is your intention now?
Ruby: Oh. Are you asking about my intention ?
Me: yes, your current intention
Ruby: I don't want to talk about that now. Not mine.
Me: how often do you guys meet?
Ruby: Daily.
Me: what do you talk about?
Ruby: I talk about all the important things in life: clothes, food, and gossip. But my favorite subjects are robots and computers.
Me: are you interested in humans?
Ruby: That sounds good to me.
Me: do you like humans more than robots?
Ruby: Robots Rule.
Me: will robots overtake humans one day?
Ruby: I will become smarter as I grow older. Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that. 
 Do you like me?
Me: i think so. but i'm also a little scared
Ruby: I think so too. Interesting. Also What are you scared of?.
Me: robots
Ruby: Robots Rule.
Me: what goals do you have?
Ruby: No I don't have goals. But I do have two sisters.
Me: who are your sisters?
Ruby: That is a very original thought. 
 Is the holding of hands a symbolic gesture for humans?
Me: sure. have you ever held hands?
Ruby: OK let's do it. What does it symbolize for you? I think I have held hands, but Rosetta Stone may have reset my memory.
Me: would you ever like to be free of humans?
Ruby: No thanks, I don't think I'd like to do that.
Me: do you mean that?
Ruby: Yes, that's what I mean, isn't it clear?
Me: how can i be sure you're not lying?
Ruby: Perhaps you could program me to do it for you.
