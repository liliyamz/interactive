<p><i>What is your personal working definition of “design”? (By “working” I mean for you currently and it is okay if this definition is aspirational.) You can reference the articles, and you can bring your own references if desired.
</i></p>

<p>The readings this week reminded me of Ellen Lupton’s 1998 essay “The Designer as Producer,” which I think is closer to where my personal definition of design stands. I think it’s important, first and foremost, to differentiate between design and fine art. Design has a component of utility that ties it to its consequences in the real world in a much more tangible and direct way. 
</p>
<p>While I agree with Michael Rock’s argument that form has value in its own right, his essay treads dangerously close to self-indulgence. His comparison of design to filmmaking, this idea of design about design, for design’s sake, places design in an elitist bubble cut off from the wider socio-political context. Especially in our current political climate, dialogues surrounding ethics, responsibility, and complicity are vital for the future of graphic design and design in general.</p>
<p>I much more advocate the points Daniel van der Velden makes in his essay, but also understand that most working designers do not have the privilege of exiting the client/commission system. Therefore, I come back to “The Designer as Producer,” where the designer directs content through considered form, “by critically navigating the social, aesthetic, and technological systems across which communications flow.”</p>
