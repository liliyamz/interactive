<p><i>“When the school asked my company to redesign it, we knew the school was an incredibly vibrant community, where students unceasingly develop new ideas about what art should be.” says Dan Michaelson about art.yale.edu. So, what should art be? The Yale School of Art’s website was made 10 years ago now. If you were tasked with a redesign or update, how might you change it to reflect your opinion?</i></p>

<p>Dan talks about wanting the site to be liked by two groups of people: people in the School of Art community and prospective students who want to join the community. In this respect, I think the site still functions quite well today as an open space for current students to exchange information and interests, as well as giving off a feeling of what being at the Yale School of Art is like through its frequently changing, oftentimes chaotic ‘decorative elements.’ Paul Chan describes art as having a sense of autonomy, capable of shaping the artist as much as the artist can shape the work. Duck or rabbit, art or artist, works of art live in the same governance structures Dan describes, open to interpretation and evolving with time – something the site still helps foster conversations about today.</p>
<p>One thing that would be interesting to update would be the addition of frameworks that address audiences outside of the Yale School of Art. The 2010 Reddit reaction to the site demonstrated a failure to communicate the overarching concept of the site to a general public. The conversations and debates happening on Reddit were quite interesting, and I wonder what new ideas or forms could arise if those dialogues were allowed to occur directly on the site itself. Art and design resides in a larger socio-political ecosystem, and the School of Art web site could serve as a tool in linking the work students explore at Yale to the greater public sphere.</p>
